**1. [webstreaming.py](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab5/webstreaming.py)**

This script simulates webstreaming using the picam.

**2.  [mini-project folder](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/tree/main/Lab5/mini-project)**

This contains a [main_rpi.py](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab5/mini-project/main_rpi.py) script that is the master controller for this project. It also contains [helper_functions](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/tree/main/Lab5/mini-project/helper_functions) and a [lab5-miniproject.png](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/tree/main/Lab5/mini-project/lab5-miniproject.png) to display the running project.


**3. [lab5-web-stream.png](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab5/lab5-web-stream.png)**

This is an image of a screenshot of the hosted web stream from the [webstreaming.py](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab5/webstreaming.py) script showing myself and my name written on a paper.

**This lab aims to help students experience the Picamera on the rpi and learn how to stream, capture images and videos, create a simple intrusion detection project as well.**
