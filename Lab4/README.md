**1. [traffic_lights.py](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab4/traffic_lights.py)**

This scripts create a class TrafficLights that has three LEDs, red, yellow and green and controls them being on or off.

**2.  [traffic_lights_test.py](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab4/traffic_lights_test.py)**

This uses the TrafficLights class creates an instance to test the functionality of the LEDs.

**3. [crosswalk_simulation.py](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab4/crosswalk_simulation.py)**

This script imports TrafficLights class and includes a button now, to simulate when a pedestrian presses the button to use a crosswalk to cross the road at a traffic light.

**4. [crosswalk_circuit img](https://github.com/SYSC3010W26/labs-AiraMens/blob/main/Lab4/crosswalk_circuit.jpeg)**

This is an image of the circuit that the crosswalk_simulation.py is run on.
